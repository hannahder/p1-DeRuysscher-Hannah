        <h1>Marvin's New Impact Glass Garage Door</h1>
        <p>While most people may focus on impact windows as a priority, having impact garage doors is equally as important, especially when dealing with a hurricane! If the amount of glass on your garage doors is minimal, then the need to switch to high impact hurricane-resistant glass and aluminum garage doors may be mistakenly overlooked. However, this should not go ignored because keeping your standard, non impact glass and garage doors could be disastrous in the event of a real, serious hurricane. Replacing your garage doors with Marvin impact-resistant glass garage doors allows for the highest rate of protection, which standard garage doors wouldn’t even have a remote chance of during a hurricane.</p>
        <p>When a tropical storm or hurricane hits, there’s no telling which area will be affected in your home, which could include all glass garage doors and windows. The best way to prepare and protect critical parts of your home from minor to extreme damage due to high impact winds and debris is to ensure that you have SIW impact-resistant windows and doors. Marvin impact windows and all glass garage doors have been proven to resist winds travelling at 210 to 390 miles per hour. These Marvin impact products are also Miami-Dade County and State of Florida Approved.</p>
        <p>A high level of efficiency and protection can be seen in high impact glass and aluminum garage doors. Marvin impact-resistant windows and garage doors provide a sense of security for your home and shield you from the damaging effects of a hurricane. It’s a wonder why everybody wouldn’t switch over to all impact glass doors and windows. With all of the benefits of hurricane protection, noise reduction, energy efficiency, and appearance, it only makes sense to invest in these quality Marvin impact glass garage doors and windows.</p>
